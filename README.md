# do-not-disturb-during-zoom

Automatically trigger "Do Not Disturb" mode while Zoom call is active. If you yourself enter do-not-disturb-mode, it should not interfere.

So far only works on macOS Big Sur 11.1.

### Setup

```
npm install -g do-not-disturb-during-zoom
```

Then find `do-not-disturb-during-zoom` executable inside your npm bin directory (`which do-not-disturb-during-zoom`), and add it to your system startup. That should be it.
